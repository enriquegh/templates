# Templates and installation script
Just run `sh install.sh`.  It will create any files as needed and add an alias.  Follow any instructions after the script has run and then create templates.


### Usage
These templates will only be sent to your Mac's clipboard.  This will not work on Windows and Linux.  Once the template is in your clipboard you can paste it anywhere.

I strongly recommend pasting it directly into Slack or a text file and then editing.  Once done editing highlight all > paste final to #distiller.  This way we, and you, can search for this thing in the future.  Once #distiller starts filling up we'll probably get some repeats that can be searched for.
